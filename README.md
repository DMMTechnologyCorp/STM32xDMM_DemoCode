# DYN4 Servo Drive with Nucleo-F072RB Demo Code
This repository contains demo code for controlling DMM Technology Corporation's DYN4 servo drive with the Nucleo-F072RB microcontroller board. The code provides a basic skeleton for menu-based simple control over the motor system with features such as position and speed commands, a homing function, enable/disable drive, and drive status reset.

# Features
Position and Speed Commands: Control the position and speed of the motor.
Homing Function: Return the motor to its home position. The home position is the inital motor position on power up.
Enable/Disable Drive: Enable or disable the servo drive.
Drive Reset: Reset the drive in the event of a fault.

# Physical Requirements
DMM Technology Corporation's DYN4 servo drive
Nucleo-F072RB microcontroller board
STM32CubeIDE or compatible IDE
USB cable for programming the Nucleo board
All required cables for servo drive connection

# Setup Instructions
*Download the required files from the release section and place them in a folder inside your workspace
*Open the .crpoject file. This should launch all the required items for the project.
*Start exploring!

# Code Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to provide those who are interested in using DMM Servo drives with Nucleo microcontrollers or even STM embedded systems. This code is intended to provide the basics for users to expand on the achieve greater control over the servo system for various projects.
