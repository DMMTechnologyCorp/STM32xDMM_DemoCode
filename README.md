# DYN4 Servo Drive with Nucleo-F072RB Demo Code
This repository contains demo code for controlling DMM Technology Corporation's DYN4 servo drive with the Nucleo-F072RB microcontroller board. The code provides a basic skeleton for menu-based simple control over the motor system with features such as position and speed commands, a homing function, enable/disable drive, and drive status reset.

## Features

- **Position and Speed Commands**: Control the position and speed of the motor.
- **Homing Function**: Return the motor to its home position.
- **Enable/Disable Drive**: Enable or disable the servo drive.
- **Drive Status Reset**: Reset the drive status.

## Requirements

- [DMM Technology Corporation's DYN4 servo drive](http://www.dmm-tech.com/DYN4_Servo_System.html)
- [Nucleo-F072RB microcontroller board](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-f072rb.html)
- [STM32CubeIDE](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html) or compatible IDE
- USB cable for programming the Nucleo board
- Power supply for the servo drive and motor

## Getting Started

### Hardware Setup

1. Connect the DYN4 servo drive to the motor.
2. Connect the Nucleo-F072RB board to the DYN4 servo drive using RS232.
3. Power up the servo drive and the Nucleo board.
4. Start Exploring

## Code Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to provide those who are interested in using DMM Servo drives with Nucleo microcontrollers or even STM embedded systems. This code is intended to provide the basics for users to expand on the achieve greater control over the servo system for various projects.
